# Predict customer churn 

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models based on historical customer data. Accurately predicting customer churn allows businesses to take preventive measures and implement strategies to retain customers, boosting revenue and customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

Customer churn refers to when a customer stops doing business with a company. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn, allowing the business to intervene before it happens. The project leverages multiple machine learning techniques to perform churn prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset contains multiple features that influence customer churn:
- **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Demographics**: Customer attributes like age, gender, income, etc.
- **Usage Data**: Information about the customerâ€™s interaction with the service (e.g., number of transactions, time spent using the service).
- **Churn Indicator**: A label that indicates whether a customer has churned or not (used as the target variable in our predictive models).

## Features of the Dataset:
1. **Demographic Data**: Age, gender, marital status, etc.
2. **Service Usage Data**: Number of services availed, duration of usage, complaints, etc.
3. **Transaction History**: Payments made, frequency of transactions, and payment method.
4. **Customer Engagement**: Frequency of interactions, customer support calls, etc.

Model performance is evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

Main libraries used:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the notebook file.
